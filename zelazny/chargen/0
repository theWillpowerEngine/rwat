You were born in Saltrice, the realm's main source of farmed goods, and despite your dreams it seemed inevitable that you too would live your life as a farmer.  Then, one day, a package arrived by special courier from Uncle Jack, and all that changed.

The package contained his leatherbound journal -- which was as much a manual of how to live a profitable life as a personal recollection -- and a letter, and it was the letter which changed the course of your life.

It said that Uncle Jack was dead, which became sadder as you read on.  He'd spent the last two decades of his life saving up a gift for you.  A way out.

Uncle Jack always was eclectic; an intrepid airship pilot and adventurer who stood as an antonym to his stoic, solid brother.  The two got along only as a politeness, and mostly for your sake, since Jack's visits has been a highlight of your relatively boring childhood.

And his final act was equally quixotic.  He'd spent his entire savings, an amount which would have set you up comfortably for several lifetimes, on a massive down payment on a brand new airship, being built at an upscale shipyard on the outskirts of Traven.  You were meant to assume both the captaincy and the mortgage, and were forbidden from selling it until the latter was fully paid off.

As you contemplated the gift and the burden both, you considered the thirst for something other than harvesting and planting, and how it had always been with you...
