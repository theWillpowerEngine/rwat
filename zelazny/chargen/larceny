The incident was still fresh in your memory, a contrast to years of plodding boredom that defined your childhood in Saltrice.  It was during harvest when everyone was busy and by all rights you should've been sweating in the fields, but your father had blessed you with a reprieve from work to go and fetch a part from the smith.

[?larc-unwilling-testimony Your abrupt answers didn't win you any friends with the victims, but you doubted they made you any enemies either.  You managed not to lie (too much), and didn't even stick around to hear the verdict|The whole experience seemed rather dingy, it didn't match your youthful expectations of what such a trial should be like.  Still in the end the bad guys were found guilty and sent off to work in the quarries to the north, so you suppose the process worked].  It was briefly the talk of not only your own village but the neighboring ones as well[?larc-commended , with your own little part featured prominently].

As they will, folks eventually got bored of it, and moved on to more pressing things, like farming corn.
