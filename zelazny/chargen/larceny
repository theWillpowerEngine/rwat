The incident was still fresh in your memory, a contrast to years of plodding boredom that defined your childhood in Saltrice.  It was during harvest when everyone was busy and by all rights you should've been sweating in the fields, but your father had blessed you with a reprieve from work to go and fetch a part from the smith.

You don't really remember when you developed your disdain for the law and its petty enforcers, but the ultimate effect of it was that you spent half a harvest in jail and lost most of the respect your family had for you.  As such things tend to, it started quickly and simply and before you had time to think about it you were already in the deep end...

Saltrice is made up of a federation of allied villages, an arrangement which has worked well to keep things peaceful in the bread basket of the Realm.  It could create diffculties, however, such as a few villages creating their own laws and policies and leaving their unfortunate visitors to sort things out.  It was somewhat unusual, but not illegal, to carry a gun in your part of town, but not so in the village you were caught in.

@larc-testified
[?larc-unwilling-testimony Your abrupt answers didn't win you any friends with the victims, but you doubted they made you any enemies either.  You managed not to lie (too much), and didn't even stick around to hear the verdict|The whole experience seemed rather dingy, it didn't match your youthful expectations of what such a trial should be like.  Still in the end the bad guys were found guilty and sent off to work in the quarries to the north, so you suppose the process worked].  It was briefly the talk of not only your own village but the neighboring ones as well[?larc-commended , with your own little part featured prominently].

As they will, folks eventually got bored of it, and moved on to more pressing things, like farming corn.

Compared to how stories describe dungeons, the village jail you found yourself in wasn't even that bad.  Two warm(ish) meals a day, only a little bit of abuse from the guards.  It wasn't something you wanted to experience again, but when you got out a week later you felt that it wasn't so bad.

The epic beating you caught from your father, however, definitely put a fear of getting caught into you.

Your family was not rich, but you were hard working and so your parents were able to cover the fine for you.  You were something of a pariah for the next six months though, and your dad worked you three times as hard as usual to make up for the lost coins.

Even years later you get reminded of this incident whenever the old man wants to score a point on you.

@larc-criminal
Compared to how stories describe dungeons, the village jail you found yourself in wasn't even that bad, at first.  As days wore into weeks and weeks became months you slowly came to understand a new and more horrible kind of boredom.  You were nostalgic for toiling in the fields by the time you were released.

Things never fully recovered between you and your family.  Your mother forgave you, but never seemed to forget, and the rest of the family was never as close to you as they had been.

You ended up being humiliated before the magistrate and having to pay a fine, which your family had to come up with for you.  You were something of a pariah for the next six months though, and your dad worked you three times as hard as usual to make up for the lost coins.
