}Later in adolescence, after a year of miserable work and a bountiful harvest, you father had finally relented to your moping and sighing and arranged for a small adventure during the winter.  A man he knew from the market arranged for you to work as a deck hand aboard a local trade ship.

The captain was a dreary man who spoke frequently of duty and discipline and he worked you ragged and treated you only slightly better than the tabby cat that oft stalked in his shadow.  Doubtless your father hoped the experience would sour your wanderlust.

The break-in goes off without a hitch, but the captain either had better hiding places than you'd expect, or was fairly broke.  You took a small trophy to remember him by a a good luck charm and left before trouble found you.

Your skills, unfortunately, don't match your ambition.  The captain comes back sooner than expected and catches you.

You are, in order: beaten up (rather gently, all things considered), whipped, and confined to a room too small to lie down in for the rest of the trip.  When you get back the captain makes sure everyone knows of the tale and you're a laughingstock for the spring and most of the summer.

No one is terribly sad you see you go, and you arrive back home in Saltrice just in time for planting season having been deprived of a winter's repose.

Though it was almost as hard as work on the farm, your winter aboard the ship cemented your desire to be free of the drudgery.  The moment you step back down onto the familiar soil you feel as if you've gone back to prison.

The captain is reluctant to see you go, doubly so when you try your best to convince him to keep you on.  Whatever deal your father made with him (or threat) holds though, and arriving back in Saltrice and stepping off the ship where you'd seemed to belong left you in a malaise that lasted for months.
