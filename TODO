----------------------
   Engine Room and Sim

Reactor:
   Finish light source error indicators (Move breach; add meltdown and paradox event; add warning states)
   Make sure Paradox/AM poisoning can work (I don't think it can now because Thaums and AM are always =)
   Add damage model and effects

Shaft/Prop controls:
   Test
   Make lubrication eventually wear off (but slowly) -- this might be a good excuse to write an event system

Lift controls:
   Lift system
   engine room additions
   "tie down" functionality for being docked (plumb very beginnings of 3d positioning)

AI (start with Engineer) and Command system

---------------

Make parents apply damage randomly to their children
