    A massive, leather-bound book that looks more like a sorcerous grimoire than a journal.  Inside, organized as only Uncle Jack could, are a variety of monographs and instructional guides designed to help ease you into the life he prepared for you.  Many of the entries are written in other hands by experts in their fields, but almost every page is annotated in the margins in your <span class="uncles-writing">uncle's compact and efficient handwriting</span>.  These bits contain anecdotal information and tips gleaned from his lifetime of experience.
