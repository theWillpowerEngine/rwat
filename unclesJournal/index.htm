    A massive, leather-bound book that looks more like a sorcerous grimoire than a journal.  Inside, organized as only Uncle Jack could, are a variety of monographs and instructional guides designed to help ease you into the life he prepared for you.

These bits contain anecdotal information and tips gleaned from his lifetime of experience.
