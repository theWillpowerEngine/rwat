    <p class="uncles-writing">There's a lot to learn in this game, way too much to bite off all at once.  There are two schools of thought for learning something like this...  the first is to deep dive on the specific things that interest you and kind of gloss over the rest, and the second is to learn just enough to get started and then figure things out with a combination of just-in-time research and trial-and-error.  This section will help you with both by giving you just enough of a foundation to allow you to get started.</p>

    <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

    <p class="uncles-writing">Gameplay occurs in <b>ticks</b>, which occur when the screen is redrawn.  By default, this occurs when you move or perform an action (allowing you to spend as much time as you want contemplating your decisions), although you can cause the game to advance on it's own by pressing P.  Most of the time you don't have to think much about this, but when things are going wrong or when timing is important, carefully picking every input and action you take can be the difference between success and failure.  Most actions which change the game state (for example:  moving around, interacting with objects, etc.) cause a tick to pass; most actions that are purely informational (looking at things, navigating menus, etc.) do not cause a tick to pass.</p>

    <p class="uncles-writing">You can click on any tile to look at it to get an idea of what it is (this is particularly useful in places with a lot of valves and switches like the engine room or wheel house).  You move around with WASD, and if you want to move diagonally you can use Shift+WASD, which is rotated 45 degrees counter clockwise.</p>
    
    <p class="uncles-writing">Moving onto an object or creature will interact with it.  Make sure you are doing so deliberately though -- this is a simulation, and accidentally hitting switches or adjusting dials can have dramatic, and sometimes even game ending, effects.</p>

    <h2>New Game Guide</h2>

    <p class="uncles-writing">When you make a new game, the first thing you'll go through is character creation.  In brief, during this process you will face several choices (some fixed and some random), which help shape your starting skills and abilities.  If you are trying for a particular type of character, choose answers that lead you that way, otherwise just pick whatever sounds best to you.  You will be able to develop your skills durnig gameplay, so none of the choices you make during character creation are permanent, they only impact your starting situation. </p>

    <p class="uncles-writing">Once this is done you find yourself in the cargo hold of your ship...</p>
