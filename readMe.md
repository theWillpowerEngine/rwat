## Ship Cold Start Procedure ##

1.  Turn on ship lights:  Turn on pilot lights;  Set desired master light default setting
2.  Start coolant pump, ensure cap charge, turbine and boiler settings are all 0/off
3.  Slowly pull control rods until desired rate of reaction change is obtained.  At ALL TIMES keep the internal temperature and pressure within tolerances.  Should the reaction start to run away, in almost all cases pressing the red SCRAM button will fully reintroduce control rods and should halt the reaction (heat and pressure will fade over time once the reaction is stopped)
4.  Once initial reaction is obtained, slowly introduce turbine and boiler settings until desired settings achieved; this may require pulling additional control rods.  Turn capacitor charge on
5.  As needed, push control rods slowly to keep reaction from running away.  Taper reaction as the turbines and boilers begin to work, seeking equilibrium.  Verify appropriate values for Thaumatic Capacitor, Boiler and Turbine Shaft in their appropriate displays
6.  Turn off the coolant pump.  Verify coolant is still visibly flowing through the pipe in the corner of the engine room.
7.
